# WorldMapGDP
Two-part project that uses the same GDP data found in GDP_XY_plots to create plots on the world map. This project investigates two ways to clean and unify multiple sets of data. The first way is done with filtering data through country names (WorldPlot1.py) and the second way through country codes (WorldPlot2.py). Doing the scripting with country codes improves the quality of the wolrd map becuase it creates better mapping from pygal country codes to World Bank country names. This comes at the price of having less efficent code and code that is harder to follow.
